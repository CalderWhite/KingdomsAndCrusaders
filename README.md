# KingdomsAndCrusaders

Originally a simulation for my ICS4UI (Grade 12 Computer Science) class.
This program simulates the behaviour of humans in the context of colonization.

In the processing directory there lies the original code that I wrote for the class.
In the root directory is a c++ port I wrote later that is capable of much larger and more complex simulations.
